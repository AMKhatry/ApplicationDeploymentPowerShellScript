Description:
This script automates the deployment process for the application. It simplifies the task of updating the deployed version by incorporating necessary steps into a single executable.

Prerequisites/Conditions:
  1. Both the deployment script and the updated version of the application packaged in a zip file must reside in the same directory.
  2. The zip file containing the updated application must be named "Build.zip".

Usage:
Upon execution, the script will prompt the user to specify the destination folder where the contents of the updated application will be deployed.

Known Bugs:
    Currently, the unzipping process is flawed, as it fails to properly ignore certain files and replaces them in the destination folder. This issue requires fixing for seamless deployment.
